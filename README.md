  # 🚀 Employee Payroll System (Java OOP Project)

  A terminal-based **Employee Payroll System** built in Java, demonstrating core  
  Object-Oriented Programming concepts: **abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.  
  Ideal for beginners and developers strengthening Java OOP fundamentals.

  - `FullTimeEmployee` – monthly salary calculation  
  - `PartTimeEmployee` – hourly wage calculation  
  - Polymorphism for flexible salary computation  
  - Encapsulated employee data with getters/setters  
  - User-friendly terminal interface  
  - Clean, modular, industry-standard OOP structure

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Demonstrated
### ✔ Abstraction  
`Employee` defines core structure and behavior for all employee types.

### ✔ Inheritance  
`FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` extend the base class.

### ✔ Polymorphism  
Each subclass overrides salary calculation independently.

### ✔ Encapsulation  
Private fields, getters, setters ensure secure data handling.
